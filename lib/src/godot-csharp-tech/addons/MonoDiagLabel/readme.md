# MonoDiagLabel

I will eventually get around to posting this in the asset library, but if you are writing a C# game this label may be useful.

it's a port of the FPS Label to C# and adds more details, such as GC collection info.. 

Addionally, I hope this is a good reference for anyone who wants to create their own C# addon.
